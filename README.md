## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding project.

Using Web 3.0 methodologies, Solidity and Metamask I have build a real Web 3.0 Transaction Application. It Allows user to send transactions through blockchain.

## USAGE
- Allows user to send transactions through blockchain.
- No need for any third party/bank in between for the transactions to occur.
